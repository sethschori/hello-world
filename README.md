Description: A simple and boring repository to get myself started using Git and GitHub.

Hello world,

I'm studying JavaScript and want to get started using Git and GitHub, so I'm following the tutorial to make my first hello-world repository. Soon I'll start adding some code to real repositories.

See you soon!
